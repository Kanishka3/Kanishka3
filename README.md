# Kanishka3

Hey Hey âœ¨ 

I am Kanishka, and I'm 16yo trying to understand computer's under-the-hoods. During day, I am student but as soon as the sun goes away, I become a developer and unleash my power.

Types of developments I can work with: iOS development, basic web development

I think that Mental health is a serious problem right now and we need some serious solutions for that! 

Fortunately, I have been an Apple WWDC19 and 20 scholar! 

I like to sip coffee! =) 

Hope you are able to debug your code today!
